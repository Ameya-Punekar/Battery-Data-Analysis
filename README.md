# Battery-Data-Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing battery performance data to derive actionable insights for improving battery efficiency and understanding degradation patterns. The analysis examines two battery types with distinct characteristics, studying their behavior under various conditions.

## Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to:
- Explore and preprocess raw battery data for efficient analysis.
- Understand battery performance metrics such as voltage, current, power, and charge/discharge cycles.
- Investigate battery degradation trends over time to estimate lifespan.
- Identify relationships between key parameters to inform predictive modeling.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Data Cleaning**: Managed missing values, removed duplicates, and prepared data for analysis.
- **Visual Insights**: Created plots to analyze trends in battery voltage, current, power, and capacity over time.
- **Degradation and Lifespan Analysis**: Quantified battery performance loss over multiple cycles.
- **Correlation Studies**: Identified relationships between metrics for feature selection in future predictive models.

## Technologies Used
- Python for data analysis and visualization
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly

## Insights
- Battery degradation follows predictable trends that can be used for lifespan estimation.
- Charge/discharge efficiency varies significantly between battery types.
- Strong correlations between parameters like voltage, current, and capacity enable advanced modeling opportunities.

## Future Scope
- Develop predictive models to forecast battery degradation and performance.
- Integrate real-time monitoring for practical applications.
- Extend the analysis to include additional battery datasets and types.
